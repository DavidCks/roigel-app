# roigel-app

An App I'm currently developing for scheduling and organizing within a small group of friends. Still early development.

Check my design files for a feel of how it will look in the future.
The frontend for the Kahnbuch and the Essensanmeldung are implemented.
I have to find a new hoster though, as heroku is getting rid of its free tier, hence why im publishing it on github as a new repo, as I've exclusively been working on the heroku remote.
