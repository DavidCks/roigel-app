# roigel-app

An App I'm currently developing for scheduling and organizing within a small group of friends. Still early development.

Check my design files for a feel of how it will look in the future.
The frontend for the Kahnbuch and the Essensanmeldung are implemented.
I have to find a new hoster though, as heroku is getting rid of its free tier, hence why im publishing it on github as a new repo, as I've exclusively been working on the heroku remote.

Have to reimplement stuff because heroku but here's what I've got so far:

- [x] Design
- [x] Icons
- [x] Login
- [x] general UI
- [x] Essensanmeldung FE (displaying DB data)
- [x] Kahnbuch FE (only mock data currently)
- [x] Profile FE
- [x] Essensanmeldung API read endpoint 

- [ ] Essensanmeldung API write/delete/update endpoints 
- [ ] Kahnbuch API endpoints
- [ ] Login FE
- [ ] Feed FE & BE implementation
- [ ] migration to a new hoster (still trying to convince friends to self-host on the shared RPi)

Built using __**PERN**__ [Postgres, express, react, node]
